# fence

Effortless way to avoid manual extern files when doing javascript
interop from Clojurescript.

That random name is a complete mess ;)

**Fence** provides a `fence.core/+++` macro that works like `do`
special form. Wrap it around all your javascript interop forms to
transform them automatically so you don't have to add extern files
manually.

## Installation

Add `fence` to your Clojurescript project:

```cljs
[fence "0.1.0"]
```
Refer to `fence.core/..` in your namespace:

```cljs
(ns hello
  "Calling property symbols that won't be renamed."
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [..])
  (:require-macros [fence.core :refer [..]]))
```

and replace all renaming-sensitive forms in column 1 with their `..`
equivalent versions demonstrated in column 2

forms that requires extern | forms that works without extern as long as `..` resolves to `fence.core/..`
-------------------------- | -------------------------------------------
`(. js/foo bar)`           | `(.. js/foo -bar)`
`(.-boo js/foo )`          | `(.. js/foo -boo)`
`(.bla js/foo)`            | `(.. js/foo bla)`
`(.bla js/foo x y z)`      | `(.. js/foo (bla x y z))`

and you're done. Of course, existing `..` forms don't need to be changed.

**Remember**: only `fence.core/..` ensures the property/method symbols
inside it won't get renamed.

## How it  works

Imagine you have this piece of Clojurescript code:

```clj
(ns hello
  "Calling property symbols that WILL be renamed."
  )
(.. js/something -someAttributes aMethod (anotherMethod "arg1" "arg2"))
```

without extern file(s), the above code will end up with this:

```js
something.d.b().c("arg1", "arg2");
```
which will fail to execute.

Instead of writing some extern files manually, just refer to
`fence.core/..` like this:

```clj
(ns hello
  "Calling property symbols that won't be renamed."
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [..])
  (:require-macros [fence.core :refer [..]]))
```
and here's (part of) the result:

```js
(function() {
  var a;
  a = something.someAttributes;
  a = a.aMethod.call(a);
  return a.anotherMethod.call(a, "arg1", "arg2");
})();
```

Never be afraid of javascript interop again! ^^

Clojurescript forms   | Output javascript         | Optimized in :advanced mode without extern     | Optimized with extern
----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------
`(. js/foo bar)`      | `foo.bar`                 | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.a`         | `foo.bar`
`(.-boo js/foo )`     | `foo.boo`                 | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.b`         | `foo.boo`
`(.bla js/foo)`       | `foo.bla()`               | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.c()`       | `foo.bla()`
`(.bla js/foo "x" 1)` | `foo.bla("x", 1)`         | renamed to a shorter name like `foo.d("x", 1)` | `foo.bla("x", 1)`


Clojurescript forms (`..` resolves to `fence.core/..`) | Output javascript              | Optimized with/without extern
-------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------
`(.. js/foo bar)`                                      | `foo["bar"]`                   | `foo.bar`
`(.. js/foo -boo)`                                     | `foo["boo"]`                   | `foo.boo`
`(.. js/foo bla)`                                      | `foo["bla"].call(foo)`         | `foo.bla.call(foo)`
`(.. js/foo (bla "x" 1))`                              | `foo["bla"].call(foo, "x", 1)` | `foo.bla.call(foo, "x", 1)`


## FAQs

1. Why no `.` macro?
 - I tried to put the `fence.core`'s equivalent macro version of `.`
   under the same name, but the Clojurescript compiler seems to ignore
   the referred symbol `.` from `fence.core`.

   You may still use `fence.core/dot` in place of `.` but it's kinda
   lengthy and introduces "alien" code which is against `fence`'s
   goals itself.

2. Are there any performance pitfalls?
 - No. Google Closure compiler will replace string versions of
   properties to symbol versions so the final javascript will be the
   same as its counterpart using *extern* files.

3. Isn't it better to write code like this? `(.. foo (a-method arg-1 arg-2))`
 - `fence` will never camelize symbols for you because it aims to be
   100% compatible with `clojure.core/..`. Once Clojurescript compiler
   is smart enough to be able to automatically produce extern files
   itself, people can come back to `clojure.core/..` from
   `fence.core/..` with no extra effort.
